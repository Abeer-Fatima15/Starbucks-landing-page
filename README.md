This guide explains how to run the Starbucks landing page files from the Abeer-Fatima15/Starbucks-landing-page GitHub repository.

Prerequisites
Git (optional): If you want to clone the repository directly, you'll need Git installed on your system. You can download it from https://git-scm.com/downloads.
Web Browser: Any modern web browser like Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari will work.

Option 1: Clone the Repository (using Git)
Open your terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the files.
Run the following command to clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Abeer-Fatima15/Starbucks-landing-page.git

This will download the project files to a new folder named Starbucks-landing-page (or whatever you named the folder during cloning).

Option 2: Download the ZIP File (without Git)
Go to the GitHub repository: https://gist.github.com/abir-taheer
Click on the green "Code" button.
Select "Download ZIP".
Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a folder on your computer.
Running the Landing Page
Once you have the project files (either by cloning or downloading), follow these steps:

Open the extracted folder.
Open the index.html file in your web browser.
The Starbucks landing page should now be displayed in your browser window.

Additional Notes
The project uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No server-side setup is required.
Any changes you make to the HTML, CSS, or JavaScript files will be reflected when you reload the index.html file in your browser.
